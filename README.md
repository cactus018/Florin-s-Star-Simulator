# Florin's Star Simulator
Lightweight, basic, star simulator made in HTML, CSS and JavaScript

See how the Sun would be affected if its mass were to be increased by 10%, doubled or quadrupled, or calculate the luminosity of any star by entering its radius and surface temperature. See interactively how the size and color of the star changes as you tinker with its characteristics. Save your favorite star designs and load them later, or share them with your friends!

Computes the mass, radius, density, luminosity, temperature and classification of a star.
